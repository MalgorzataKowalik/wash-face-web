                    <h1>cleaner</h1>
                    <p>In the morning, start by splashing your face with warm water or, if you must, wash with a gentle face cleanser designed for your skin type. Do you have dry, oily, combination, or  sensitive skin? Use <a href="#">this</a> chart to identify your skin type. There's no need to use rough pads or scrub aggressively; this won't get your skin any cleaner. Don't use harsh bar soaps, antibacterial hand washes, and the like on your face. Harsh soaps won't clear your acne, but they will irritate your skin. Don't forget about cleaning your jawline, neck, and in front of and behind the ears.</p>

                    <h1>toner</h1>
                    <p>Most people choose to skip toners, partly because there’s a lingering assumption that most toners are harsh and irritate the skin. Fortunately, that’s not the case anymore. While they don’t physically “shrink” pores, the new breed of toners can serve multiple purposes, like act as a delivery system for antioxidants, vitamin B derivatives and even toning acids. Additionally, each type of toner is intended for a different skin issue, so it’s important to use the right kind for your skin concern.

                    However, if you have lived all your life without using a toner and your skin looks healthy, there is no need to start using one. Toners were created to help return the skin’s pH after it became too basic from harsh soaps. If you have a toner that you like using, there’s no harm in sticking with it.</p>

                    <h1>serum</h1>
                    <p>Serums are super-concentrated, nutrient-dense treatments that address specific concerns, so it’s better to keep them as close to the skin as possible. There are various serums available on the market today, but for daytime, it is recommended to use antioxidant serums, which provide a variety of benefits—from blunting your skin’s inflammatory response to neutralizing damage from UV rays and environmental pollutants.</p>

                    <h1>moisturizer</h1>
                    <p>Yes, everyone needs a moisturizer, even if you have oily skin. Even though your body has its own natural lubricating system consisting of glands that secrete oil (or sebum) to maintain a protective coating against harsh outside conditions and infections, most of us do need extra hydration after the havoc that sun, weather and harsh chemicals wreak on our skin.

                    Most experts recommend that the best time to apply a moisturizer is while the skin is still damp, so the sooner you go through applying your serum and treatment, the sooner you’re able to lock in much-needed hydration with your moisturizer.
                        
                    If you’re using an acne spot treatment, you may want to skip those areas when applying your moisturizer to make sure the ingredients in it won’t interfere with the active ingredients in your spot treatment.</p>

                    <h1>sunscreen</h1>
                    <p>Sunscreen should be the last step in your daytime skin care routine if you’re using a physical or mineral sunscreen, which works by physically blocking UV rays. This step becomes tricky when you’re using a chemical sunscreen.

                    Chemical sunscreens have to be absorbed into the skin to be effective, so applying after your moisturizer will delay and hinder that. However, if you apply your chemical sunscreen before your moisturizer, your moisturizer will not work as well either because the skin is coated with chemical sunscreen.
                        
                    As for those who like using chemical sunscreens, try to look for a formula that offers moisturizing benefits, so you can get your daily hydration needs while protecting your skin.</p>
